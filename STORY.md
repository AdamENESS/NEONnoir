# Intro
The acid rain washed the city's neon blood into the Gutter; the home for those who ran out of Options.

The Gutter wasn't just a cliche metaphor, it was the city's most ruthless and dangerous district. Few chose to live there willingly; when your credits run dry and nobody is willing to buy your Options, there is nowhere left to go.

The police kept their distance from the Gutter as it didn't serve their corporate interests. If you wanted justice, you either took matters into your own hand or scrounged together enough to hire someone like me.

Blake Steel: private investigator. I took that name from a trashy crime serial. To a lost kid from the Gutter, a two-credit detective novel was like a promise of hope from God. It was my bible and my blueprint and it led me out of the Gutter to make something of myself.

Now look at me, walking alone down dark alleyways filled with human waste and wasted humans looking for someone else who got lost.
